# Subagents

Each subagent is headless, has its own context window, cannot see the parent conversation, cannot ask the user, and cannot spawn subagents or workflows. Give every child a self-contained prompt with paths, constraints, and the expected report.

## Pi Harness

**Harness:** `pi`
**Prompt nicknames:** “pi”, “pi agent”, “pi subagent”
**Best default:** Use when the user does not request another harness. It inherits the parent model and thinking level when `model` or `reasoning_effort` is omitted.

Do not use models from the Anthropic provider even if one appears in the model list.

Pi can use any model shown by `pi --list-models`. Prefer `provider/model-id`; a bare model id only works when unambiguous. Common picks in this environment:

| Model                       | Recommended effort |
| --------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-luna` | `xhigh`            |
| `openai-codex/gpt-5.6-sol`  | `high`             |

**Thinking budgets:** `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. These map directly to pi thinking levels.

## Codex Harness

**Harness:** `codex`
**Prompt nicknames:** “codex”, “Codex CLI”, “codex agent”, “codex subagent”
**Best default:** `gpt-5.6-luna` with `xhigh` effort for coding work. Do not use anything other than sol unless the user specifically asks for it.

| Model          | Recommended effort |
| -------------- | ------------------ |
| `gpt-5.6-luna` | `xhigh`            |
| `gpt-5.6-sol`  | `high`             |

**Thinking budgets accepted by the extension:** `off`, `minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`. Codex maps these to the nearest effort supported by the selected model; `off`/`minimal` become `minimal`, while `max` becomes the highest extension-supported Codex effort.

Requires the Codex CLI to be installed and authenticated.

## Spawn and Manage

Call `subagent_spawn` with a complete `prompt`, short `name`, chosen `harness`, and optional `working_dir`, `model`, and `reasoning_effort`. At most four subagents run concurrently.

- `subagent_check({ id })`: peek without blocking; does not consume automatic result delivery.
- `subagent_list()`: list all runs.
- `subagent_wait({ ids })`: block only when results are required to proceed. If `subagent_check` reports a settled result still queued and you will summarize it, call `subagent_wait` before responding so the completion cannot appear afterward.
- `subagent_cancel({ ids })`: stop runs while preserving partial transcripts.
- `/subagents`: inspect or take over a run interactively.

Results return automatically. After spawning, continue useful parent work instead of immediately waiting.
